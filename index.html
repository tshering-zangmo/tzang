        <h2> Bhutanese Food</h2>
        <h3>Posted October 19th</h3>   
        <p id="tshering">Buckwheat is eaten mainly in Bumthang,
             maize in the Eastern districts, and rice elsewhere.
             The diet in the hills also includes chicken, yak meat,
             dried beef, pork, pork fat, and lamb. Soups and stews
             of meat, rice, ferns, lentils, and dried vegetables,
             spiced with chili peppers and cheese, are a favorite 
             meal during the cold seasons. Zow shungo is a rice dish 
             mixed with leftover vegetables.</p>

        <p>Bhutan cuisine is, therefore, a pleasant rich mix of many different foods,
           giving you a uniquely Bhutanese experience. Despite the variety, 
           one thing is constant: the Bhutanese love their chilis and spices like no other.</p>

        <h2> Travel</h2>  
        

        <h3>Posted October 19th</h3>
        <p style="background-color:lightpink">Travel is the movement of people between 
            distant geographical locations. Travel can
            be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train,
            boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with 
            or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.</p>
            <Travel style="background-color:lightpink">Travel can also include relatively short stays between
            successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>

        <p id="pppp">Adventuring not only expands your mind
             by building up your bravery, but is also an opportunity
              to grow and learn. New environments and cultures are packed
              full of meaningful life lessons that you might not be exposed 
              to in your everyday life. Adventures expand the way we see and
              interact with the world.

        <p>While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, 
           and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and
           technological advances over many years have tended to mean
           that travel has become easier and more accessible.Humankind
           has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus
           sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which
           took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 
           21st century when aircraft allows travel from Spain to the United States overnight.</p>
